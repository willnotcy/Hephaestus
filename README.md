# Hephaestus 🛠️ 

A homelab forged with **Proxmox**, **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **K3s**, **Flux**, and **Renovate**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Hephaestus** is a mono repository for managing my Kubernetes-based homelab. It handles everything from provisioning and configuring virtual machine nodes to automating application deployments and managing backups.

I'm transitioning from a setup based on Proxmox VMs and LXC containers to a more modern, Kubernetes-native environment. The goal is to automate everything—spinning up bare-metal servers, bootstrapping K3s, deploying apps, and keeping everything in sync through CI/CD workflows.

This project is a learning playground, a passion project, hopefully—a way to achieve a wife approved home automation setup.

## 🛠️ Goals

- Replace my current Proxmox-based VM/LXC infrastructure with a Kubernetes-first approach
- Automate everything from bare metal provisioning to app deployment
- Maintain a declarative, self-healing, and idempotent system
- Learn and implement best practices around GitOps, CI/CD, Kubernetes security, and infrastructure automation

---

## 📊 Current Status

> \_"Under active development. Expect chaos, pain, and possibly fire."

- ✅ Proxmox environment running
- ✅ Terraform/Ansible bootstrapping complete
- ✅ K3s cluster deployed
- ✅ Flux desired state deployments
- ✅ Automatic backup and restore of Persitent Volumes ([volsync](https://volsync.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
- ⏳ Migrate all LXC applications 
- ⏳ Setup observability/monitoring

## 💥 Things I Broke

- **[2025-03-27] The Great Namespace Refactor Disaster**\
  [Commit 3faa0e2](https://github.com/willnotcy/Hephaestus/commit/3faa0e28c636eecd0b08e4a1e607efecfc216ff7) — Moved all `namespace.yaml` files for better structure... and accidentally wiped every application and all their persistent volumes. Learned the hard way how the prune option for Flux kustomizations is applied.
